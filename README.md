# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Over the years, the internet has expanded significantly. It involves not only linking computer networks but also a large number of global devices that use big data. The Internet offers the chance to develop a variety of advances for every industry, including financial technology, e-commerce, education, health, and public facilities. Despite its benefits, the internet may also be a target for harmful activities and cyberattacks that could harm anyone linked to it. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to detect any cyberattacks that try to access the network system so that it can recognize those incoming intrusions beforehand and sends an alert.

## Proposed Solution:
The three attack detection techniques used by the IDS are hybrid-based detection, anomaly-based detection, and signature-based detection. New forms of attacks cannot be detected using signature-based detection since their signatures do not exist in the database. Anomaly-based detection, which checks current user activity against established profiles, is used to detect odd behaviors in order to get around this issue, however, it frequently produces a significant number of false positives. Therefore, utilizing a hybrid-based detection, which combines two or more intrusion detection methods, can be utilized to get beyond the drawbacks of using a single approach and to gain the benefits of using two or more methods.
